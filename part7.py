# Write your commend using python comments
# Answer:
#   Assuming you have created the remote git repository and git installed, the first step in the terminal is to
#   travel to the directory of the project using cd [the path to the project]. Afterward, type "git init" to initialize
#   the local repository. To connect to the remote repository, type "git remote add origin [your github git url or ssh]"
#   Now, you can make commits by adding the files to the staging area using "git add ." and committing using "git commit
#   -m '[title of commit]'". Finally, pushing from your local repository to your remote using "git push -u origin main"
#   for your first push. Consequent pushes can use "git push" as the local 'main' branch is already connected.
